When you have dozens of plugins it can be a pain to find the specific one you're looking for in a long list. Now you can just start typing and the list of plugins will be filtered showing only the plugin names that match your search.

= Compare the Active Plugins Between Two Sites =

Have you ever wanted to compare which plugins are active between two sites? It used to take a lot of brain power. Now after installing this plugin on both sites simply copy and paste a line of text to see hwich plugins need to be activated to make the two sites match.

If you're on a multisite network just select the name of the site you want to compare from the drop down.

= See Which Plugins Are Active on Each Site in a Multisite Network =

Do you have plugins sitting around that you're not sure if they're being used on any sites in a multisite network? Use the Plugins Report feature located under the Network Admin Plugins section to see which sites a plugin is active on. It will even give you a list of plugins that aren't activated on any site so you can safely delete those unused plugins.
