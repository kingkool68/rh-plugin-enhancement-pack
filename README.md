When you have dozens of plugins it can be a pain to find the specific one you're looking for in a long list. Now you can just start typing and the list of plugins will be filtered showing only the plugin names that match your search.

## Compare the Active Plugins Between Two Sites

Have you ever wanted to compare which plugins are active between two sites? It used to take a lot of brain power. Now after installing this plugin on both sites simply copy and paste a line of text to see hwich plugins need to be activated to make the two sites match.

If you're on a multisite network just select the name of the site you want to compare from the drop down.

Do you have plugins sitting around that you're not sure if they're being used on any sites in a multisite network? Use the Plugins Report feature located under the Network Admin Plugins section to see which sites a plugin is active on. It will even give you a list of plugins that aren't activated on any site so you can safely delete those unused plugins.
